<span class="maintextheader1"><strong>Submission Instructions</strong>:</span><br><br>
We solicit two types of submissions: regular workshop papers and cross-submissions. The submission website is at: <a href="">TBD</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>Regular Workshop Papers:</strong> We invite anonymized submissions of 4-8 pages (with unlimited pages for references). Please use the ACL 2019 style files, available at <a href="http://acl2019.org/calls/papers/">http://acl2019.org/calls/papers/</a>. 
<br>
These regular submissions should report substantially original research. They will be reviewed in a double-blind manner (so should be anonymized appropriately) and the accepted papers will be presented as posters or oral. All accepted regular workshop papers will appear in the ACL anthology's workshop proceedings.
<br><br>
<strong>Cross-Submission Papers:</strong> To expand the breadth and diversity of this inter-disciplinary workshop, we also encourage submission of papers that have already been published elsewhere (e.g., at robotics conferences or workshops).
These papers will be presented as posters, will not be included in the proceedings, and will not be eligible for best paper awards. Please indicate the original venue on the softconf submission website.
For cross-submission paper, there are no anonymization or format restrictions, though we still encourage using the ACL 2019 style files.
	
<br><br>
<span class="maintextheader1"><strong>Presentation Format</strong>:</span><br><br>
For each accepted paper, we will decide oral or poster presentation, based on reviewer suggestions and the overall workshop schedule.
	
<br><br>
	
	
<span class="maintextheader1"><strong>Best Paper Awards</strong>:</span><br><br>
Selected paper(s) from the regular submission category will be recognized with best paper awards and cash prizes supported by our sponsor(s).
